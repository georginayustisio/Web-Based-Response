                <p>Initially, this statement seems very paradoxical to me because how can the internet be both global and local at the same time? The internet is supposed to be an open and public space. Still, the dependence on complex and expensive infrastructure allows governments to put in filters and take control over the internet traffic in and out of the country for political reasons. These regional restrictions aided the popularity of VPNs. Nowadays, people have multiple ways to go around the respective region restrictions. However, it still takes an extra amount of effort, which may be unnecessary for some people. </p>
